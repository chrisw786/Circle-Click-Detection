# Circle Click Detection
This project is great for beginners and anyone interested in understanding basic geometry concepts in programming.

## Description
A dynamic, full-screen Python application that demonstrates the use of the Pythagorean theorem to detect mouse clicks within a circle. This interactive tool, built with Pygame, includes a user-friendly pause menu and real-time feedback on click proximity. Perfect for exploring basic geometric calculations in game development and GUI design.

## Features
- Full-screen adaptability for any PC screen size.
- Visual demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem for point-in-circle detection.
- Interactive pause menu with "Resume" and "Quit" options.
- Real-time feedback on the accuracy of clicks relative to the circle.

## Requirements
- Python 3
